\section*{Course Description}
This is a first Ph.D course in empirical industrial organization. The focus is on bringing everyone up to speed with the modern toolkit developed by empirical IO scholars over the past thirty years. This toolkit has been tremendously influential in understanding more traditional IO questions (mergers, collusion, contracting, etc.) but has recently become influential in other disciplines (healthcare, environmental economics, and education). The underlying themes are: most real-world markets are neither perfectly competitive, nor strict monopolies, but rather involve strategic interactions among firms and consumers; and when we observe equilibrium outcomes of these markets in data they are often characterized by simultaneity or endogeneity.

Because we have a limited amount of time, I will focus primarily on technique rather than questions.

\section*{How to do IO?}
Our goal is to bring you up to speed with the research frontier in Industrial Organization. This cannot be accomplished with less than thirty hours of lectures. Most of your work is going to take place outside the classroom

\begin{description}
\item[Seminars and Workshops:] My expectation is that you will all attend the IO seminar and the student workshops. Researchers do not immediately produce published papers, it is important to understand the \textit{process} as well. It is important to understand both what works and what does not.
\item[Problem Sets:] The problem sets for this course are going to take some time. You cannot start them the night before they are due. There is no STATA command for understanding equilibrium interactions in imperfectly competitive markets. You can use whichever language you would like (R, Matlab, Python). For programming tasks it is usually valuable to work in pairs, so that you can help one another find mistakes, but you must produce your own work. 
\item[Reading:] I read approximately one research paper every day. There is a large literature to catch up on. It is expected that you read all of the starred articles on the syllabus, but you should be reading papers (in varied levels of detail) all of the time. In the topics you are interested in, or are having trouble understanding, you should read additional artciles.
\item[Other Courses:] Obviously you should take the rest of the IO sequence (Prof. Jovanovic's course focuses on analytic models, and Prof. Lazarev's course is more of a sequel to this course.) You should also take as much micro-theory and econometrics as you can (especially Prof. Vuong's course).
\end{description}

\section*{Books IO Economists Own}
These are some books that most IO economists own. There is no official textbook for this course.
\begin{itemize}
\item Tirole (1988). \textit{Theory of Industrial Organization}. The book covers only theoretical work, and is over 30 years old so many newer results are missing. This is still the most important reference for the field.
\item Cabral (2000). \textit{Introduction to Industrial Organization} and Shy (1996) \textit{Industrial Organization: Theory and Applications}. These are undergraduate books on IO theory. I will assume that you perfectly understand everything in these books, though this assumption is likely false (at least at the beginning of the semester).
\item Whinston (2006). \textit{Lectures on Antitrust}. This is a short book of Ph.D lectures on antitrust topics. The chapter on vertical issues is especially relevant.
\item Kwoka and White (2013). \textit{The Antitrust Revolution} Now in the 6th edition. This book provides a lot of descriptive information about the economic context of recent antirust cases.
\item Davis and Garces (2009). \textit{Quantitative Techniques for Competition and Antitrust Analysis}. This is a ``cookbook'' style book that covers the practice of antirust.
\item Anderson, de Palma, and Thisse (1992) \textit{Discrete Choice Theory of Product Differentiation}. This links the theory of product differentiation to statistical models of consumer choice. The first few chapters are especially relevant, and the last few chapters include some ideas that still haven't been fully incorporated into empirical work.
\item Train (2009). \textit{Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation}. This book summarizes the earlier statistical discrete choice literature most associated with the work of McFadden in the 1970's and 1980s'. It does so in great detail with many clear examples. (The focus is primarily on cases where endogeneity is not a major concern).
\item Judd (1988). \textit{Numerical Methods in Economics}. This is a classic text in computation for economics. Many of these techniques were developed with macroeonomics rather than industrial organization in mind, but this is still a valuable reference.
\item Hayashi (2000) \textit{Econometrics} and Pagan and Ullah (1999) \textit{Nonparametric Econometrics} are good econometrics references and may be more applicable to IO examples than Wooldridge, etc.. 
\end{itemize} 


\section*{Course Policy}
You are expected to attend every lecture and it is expected that you have done the reading BEFORE the class.
\subsection*{Grading Policy}
\begin{itemize}
\item 50\% of your grade will be performance on homework.
\item 20\% of your grade will be performance on a referee report.
\item 20\% of your grade will be performance on your presentation.
\item 10\% of your grade will be participation in class.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Academic Dishonesty Policy}
Don't cheat. Most PhD IO courses give similar assignments. You may be able to find solutions online. Please don't do that. It is helpful to work with a partner on debugging code, but my expectation is that assignments are 100\% your own work (including computer code).
